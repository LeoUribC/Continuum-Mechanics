.. _test:

This is a new feature!
======================

in this file we will be testing if it's possible to render some markdown files and python commands such as the following:

.. code-block:: python

   def sayHello(name):
      print(f"hello {name}, that's a cool name")
      pass

we will also test LaTEX, in a single line such as :math:`\text{A} = \pi r^2h` and full line:

.. math::
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \tag{1}

also, we can try one line code highlight ``oneLine()``
