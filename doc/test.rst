.. _test:

This is a new feature!
======================

in this file we will be testing if it's possible to render some markdown files and python commands such as the following:

.. code-block:: python
   print("hello world")

we will also test LaTEX, in a single line such as $\text{A} = \pir^2h$ and full line:

.. math::
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \tag{1}
