Welcome to continuum-mechanics's documentation!
===============================================

.. _repository: https://github.com/LeoUribC/Continuum-Mechanics.git

In this documentation will be an attempt to put in practice some key concepts
learned through two of the courses that are actually being given in this
semester, which are "scientific software engineering" and "computational
mechanics".

Here, will be solved the proposed exercises in computational mechanics using
scientific software engineering concepts to keep a nice and clean documentation
using clean code techniques and documentation tools learned so far.

All the proposed exercises are listed in the **contents** section, the code
files are visible in the `repository`_ with the python test files.

Navigate through the contents below to see the step-by-step solution to every
proposed exercise:
