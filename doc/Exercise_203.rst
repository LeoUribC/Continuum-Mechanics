Exercise 20.3
=============

Show that the right side of (20.4) can be written as:

.. math::
   \rho \frac{ dv_j }{dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \rho v_j \right) +
   \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} \left( \rho v_i v_j \right) \tag{1}

and use this result to derive the equation for the balance of linear momentum for a
control volume fixed in space.


**Solving**
-----------

Note that (20.4) is given by:

.. math::
   \frac{ \partial \sigma_{ij} }{ \partial x_i } + \rho b_j = \rho \frac{ dv_j }{dt}

Taking the right side of the proposed expression
